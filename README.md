# Ultrasonic-waterhight
Measure a water hight beneath a house with an ultrasonic sensor and compensate for temperature 
(..which is quite silly at those distances.. but it is just fun)
This project combines various code snippits for LCD, EEPROM, DS18B20 over OneWire.
It was developed on an Arduino Uno board and later transformed into Arduino Mini 5 Volt, that was a new step for me.
